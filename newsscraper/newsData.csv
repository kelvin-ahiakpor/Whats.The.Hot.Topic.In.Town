"Ghana Elections - Ethnicity Is Not Allowed in the Country's Politics, Yet It Still Helps Shape Outcomes",ghana,"Ghana, which has more than 70 ethnic groups, has been among the   in Africa since 1992. It has achieved this by outlawing the use of ethnicity in party politics. The   bars the explicit use of social identities in party politics. That includes ethnic group names, symbols, colours, or artefacts. Yet, Ghanaian politics is not completely devoid of ethnicity. Political scientist   explains why this matters as Ghana prepares for another election in December. Ethnicity has had a disruptive effect on Ghana since colonial times. The British used ethnicity to advance their  . Kwame Nkrumah, the country's first postcolonial leader, inherited this and   Asante   over whether newly independent Ghana should be a federal or unitary state. A federal state would have given more autonomy to dominant chieftaincies and ethnic groups like the  . Nkrumah didn't want this. The unitary model won. However, the development of the unitary state was complicated by vulnerabilities associated with multiple social identities and socioeconomic decay. Ghana's   since 1966 were all mediated by some degree of ethnic grievances. Ghana has nine major ethnic groups. The biggest are Akans, inclusive of Asantes (47.5%), Mole-Dagbanli (16.6%), and Ewe (13.9%). There is religious diversity too.   form two-thirds of the total population. There are also   (17.6%),   (5.2%) and   (5.2%). Successive governments, both democratic and military, have taken steps to curb the crisis of ethnicity in public life. For instance, Nkrumah dissolved ethnic and regional political parties through the   in 1956. The country's military leader from 1972 to 1978,  , banned ethnic symbols or expressions from official documents. The 1992 constitution, currently in use, followed suit. The de-ethnicisation of party politics in 1992 was accompanied by the removal of party politics and ethnicity from the local government level. This meant that officials were elected to administer cities and local authorities without considerations of political party affiliation. I   this innovation and its significance for political stability. My findings confirm that ethnicity has widely been tamed in Ghanaian politics. Fourteen of the country's 16 regions have narrower margins of voting or have swing constituencies. The Ashanti and Volta regions are the exceptions. They comprise about a quarter of the voting population;   of residents in the Ashanti and Volta regions are Asantes and Ewes respectively. Since 1992, the Asantes have voted consistently for the  . Ewes, meanwhile, have voted for the  . These two parties have won every election since the country returned to democratic rule. I interrogated several possible explanations for this ethnic voting pattern. These include the backgrounds of party candidates, ownership of political parties and allocation of resources to strongholds. I also checked tensions between in-group and national identity (citizenship). And I assessed prejudices among the Asantes and Ewes. None, by itself, offers an adequate explanation. Ethnicity still influences electoral outcomes in Ghana. However, this happens on a limited scale and is to be expected in a multi-ethnic society. In silencing ethnic voices in party politics, the 1992 constitution introduced several alternative avenues for multi-ethnic self-expression. These include establishing locally led local government authorities and leaving customary land governance to chiefs and families. These avenues provide options for local (and ethnically homogeneous) communities to make decisions on their development. They can also participate in local politics without explicitly referencing party politics. The effect is that, while there are some elements of ethnicity in party politics, most Ghanaians do not see national elections as a zero sum game. Local assembly elections are also peaceful compared to national, party-driven elections. Together with other socioeconomic factors, ethnicity will continue to influence party politics in Ghana. This includes the upcoming  . However, this will not have security implications like ethnic based clashes for the country's democracy.

Support for the New Patriotic Party and the National Democratic Congress in the Asante and Volta regions is unlikely to change. This is despite the exit of a prominent Asante politician,  , from the governing New Patriotic Party to form a new political party after he lost to the vice-president,  , in the primaries. It is instructive to note that the two major parties are led by candidates from Mole-Dagbanli backgrounds. The ethnic background of politicians has not mattered much in determining electoral outcomes in Ghana, and that is unlikely to change. Beyond the Ashanti and Volta regions, support for the two main political parties over the last few decades have been widely influenced by factors such as the socio-economic conditions of urban populations and party campaign promises. Recent economic policies of the ruling government, such as its   and the   that hit the urban middle class the most, will likely have more of an impact on the urban population's voting decisions.",https://theconversation.com/ghana-elections-ethnicity-is-not-allowed-in-the-countrys-politics-yet-it-still-helps-shape-outcomes-234818

2024 General Election - We'd Complete Abandoned Projects Nationwide,ghana,"The Flagbearer of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), John Dramani Mahama says he will complete all abandoned projects across the country before starting new ones after winning the 2024 elections. To that end, he said, the party had commissioned special team that was taking inventory of all abandoned projects and would forward it to the leadership for the necessary action. Additionally, he indicated the NDC's resolve not to tread the path of the current administration as it was committed to completing all ongoing projects in the country. Former Present Mahama said this when he formerly introduced, Prof. Naana Jane Opoku- Agyemang, his running mate in the 2024 presidential elections. The introduction of the running mate who is a native of Komenda in the Komenda-Edina-Eguafo- Abrem (KEEA) Constituency of the Central Region follows the party's national campaign launched held in Tamale. It also served as a platform to ask for the blessings of chiefs and people of the region for the NDC in this year's presidential and parliamentary elections. The NDC, according to the former President, would take up the constitutional amendment review process after winning this year's elections, stating ""we have used this constitution for more than 30 years, this is the time for us to look at it."" Due to the absolute power in the President with respect to appointment, he said, the Constitutional Review Committee for instance recommended 15 as the cap for the Supreme Court. The next NDC administration according to Mr Mahama, would give chiefs some authority in terms of sanitation and environmental protection in the traditional authority because the agencies mandated to do so were unable to do so because they don't really have an attachment to the areas. He noted that, the inspirational journey and achievement of Prof. Opoku-Agyemang, he indicated, show the testament of the values and excellence that the Central Region embodies. He said his running mate was courteous, cultured, scholarly humbled, compassionate and sensitive to the needs of all people, saying ""she is full of wisdom, she is like open book and her integrity is 100 per cent intact."" He indicated that the country was at the crossroads, adding that ""our nation has been driven to the edge of collapsing and said he was happy to be at home."" The NDC, he indicated had not left the Central Region out when in government and said the party left significant additions to the infrastructure of the region. He said during the eight-year of Prof. Mills and Mahama administration, the party constructed the Komenda Sugar Factory that had been recklessly abandoned under the current administration. He gave an assurance that, the next NDC administration would do everything under its power to operationalise the Komenda Sugar factory so that it can provide employment for the youth in the region. The party, he stated build the Elmina Fish Processing Plant, rebuild the Elmina Castle Bridge, Cape Coast Sports Stadium, Kotokuraba Market, establish the Essuershia water treatment plant, connected hundreds of communities to the national electricity grid, constructed new secondary schools and E-Blocks from various parts of the region among others. Prof. Naana Opoku-Agyemang according to former President Mahama, was incorruptible and had sound moral values and said she brought unparalleled dedication to improving the education landscape when she served as a Minister of Education. He said it was under the watch of his running mate that the construction of 124 community day school started with more than 73 of those model E-Blocks completed before the NDC lost the 2016 elections. He said, many of those school blocks had been abandoned and had been overrun by weeds, saying ""I can assure you that we are going to complete all such projects when we assume leadership of the country in 2025.""

Demand for Dollar to Increase As Importers Prepare for Christmas Festivities,ghana,"Currency dealers are cautioning that the demand for the dollar will rise in August as importers begin placing orders for Christmas goods. Traditionally, the   has depreciated from August through November, a trend exacerbated in the past two years by delays in the cocoa syndicated loan and Ghana's exclusion from the capital market due to its debt distress. As July ends, market watchers are urging the Bank of Ghana and the government to take proactive measures to prevent a rapid depreciation of the cedi. ""During the third quarter, seasonal trends indicate that demand for the greenback will start building up from next month, continuing through the third quarter and into the fourth due to goods being imported for Christmas activities. Therefore, there is no respite for the cedi in sight, at least not this quarter,"" Kodzo Dziwornu Letsa told The Accra Times. Another threat to the Cedi's stability is the rising cost of fuel on the international market. Ghana's oil imports increased from $422.6 million in May 2024 to $428.3 million in June 2024, placing significant strain on the cedi and potentially undermining recent economic gains. The bid/offer ratio is currently around GH¢15.67/ GH¢15.77, indicating a 1.48% decline in the cedi's value relative to the US dollar. The spike in oil imports has led to increased demand for foreign exchange, further pressuring the cedi. In response, the Bank of Ghana sold $40 million to oil importers through the Bulk Distribution Companies (BDCs) forex auction. To prevent a free fall of the cedi typically seen during this period, the Central Bank will need to sustain its interventions and act earlier. Although the country's Gross International Reserve has increased from 2.9 months of import cover in May to 3.1 months in June, this offers limited comfort for the government to intervene regularly in the market. Other analysts suggest that the government may need to seek additional dollar inflows from Afrexim Bank or expedite the process to secure the cocoa syndicated loan by its traditional month of September, rather than November or December as has been the case in recent years.",https://theaccratimes.com/demand-for-dollar-to-increase-as-importers-prepare-for-christmas-festivities/

30 Midwives Undergo Training in Mother-to-Child Hepatitis B Transmission,ghana,"More than 30 midwives in the Ga Central Municipal Health Directorate on Friday received training in mother-to-child Hepatitis B transmission, organised by the Municipal Health Directorate and the Member of Parliament (MP) for Anyaa Sowutuom Constituency, Dr Dickson Adomako Kissi. The midwives, coming from about 15 facilities in the Ga Central Municipal Health Directorate, were trained in the mother-to-child transmission prevention, causes, early vaccination and data management and reporting. The Municipal Director of Health Services, Dr Edwina Appiah, said the training formed part of efforts to create awareness about the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection ahead of its commemoration which falls on July 28. She said it was also to enhance the midwives' knowledge and improve their attitudes and practices towards Hepatitis B infection and its vaccination. She said Hepatitis B was a viral infection that affects the liver and could cause both acute and chronic infection, which may be detected within 30-60 days after infection. According to her, studies showed that in Ghana the prevalence rate of the HBV was estimated at 13 per cent, with females being the most infected. ""This makes it alarming and it is important individuals gets vaccinated, wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water after any potential exposure to blood and use condoms with sexual partners,"" she added. Dr Appiah indicated that the mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B infection remained a major public health concern, particularly in Ghana, and adequate knowledge of physicians and midwives was crucial in averting most of the hepatitis B viral transmissions from mothers to their newborns. However, there seems to be a gap in knowledge of some physicians and midwives in Ghana in spite of the increasing incidence of hepatitis B infection in the country. ""This is why through the Member of Parliament, this workshop has been organised to enhance their knowledge on the disease and its causes for proper intervention,"" she added. The Health Director urged pregnant women to seek early vaccination to prevent their new babies from being infected. The Municipal Health Information Officer, Naomi offei, in a presentation on data management and reporting, said documentation and reporting of service data was very important and must be done using the appropriate tools.

""Ghana's supreme court unfortunately upheld the British colonial legacy of criminalizing so-called 'unnatural sex,""' said  , interim lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights director at Human Rights Watch. ""The law had been challenged on the grounds that it violated the constitutionally protected rights to privacy and personal liberties, rights that everyone has under international law as well, and regardless of their sexual orientation."" Ghana's constitution ensures respect for human dignity, protection of personal liberty, and the right to privacy for all. Yet,  , and   in recent years with debates about the bill. Prince Obiri-Korang, a law lecturer at the University of Ghana, initiated the suit to overturn the law. Under section 104(1)(b) of   1960 (Act 29), inherited from the British colonial law, ""whoever has unnatural carnal knowledge[...]of a person sixteen years or older, with his consent, is guilty of a misdemeanor."" Unnatural carnal knowledge is defined in section 104(1)(2) as ""sexual intercourse with a person in an unnatural manner or with an animal."" According to the supreme court judges, ""unnatural manner"" also includes the use of sex toys. With this ruling, the court has expanded the interpretation of Section 104(1)(b), apparently adopting language from the anti-LGBT   which specifically prohibits a person, in clause four, from engaging in any acts that undermine the proper human sexual rights and Ghanaian family values. In 2017, while Human Rights Watch was researching the impact of this law, Jones Blantari, chief superintendent of Ghana's police force,  , ""the term unnatural carnal knowledge is vague, does not have any clear meaning in law, creates difficulties in consistent interpretation and its application is used to target LGBT people."" The bill carries heavier criminal penalties for same-sex activities, increasing the maximum penalty from three years to five years in prison, and expands the possibility of extending criminal charges against anyone who identifies as LGBT, queer, pansexual, and any other non-conventional gender identity as well as allies to these communities. It would also punish anyone providing support, funding, or public advocacy for sexual and gender minorities rights.

Members of parliament introduced the bill in 2021. In addition to expanding the possibility of criminal charges against those advocating for LGBT rights, the bill allows for criminal charges against anyone who uses social media platforms to produce, publish, or disseminate content promoting activities prohibited by the bill. Significant figures in Ghana publicly opposed the bill, including the Roman Catholic Cardinal of Ghana  , and a former member of parliament and major political party chair  Nkrumah   to veto the anti-LGBT bill,   ""brutal, harsh, and unjust."" Nkrumah's father, the late Kwame Nkrumah, is a key figure in African and Ghanaian history. In the 1950s and 1960s, he led the independence movement and served as the country's first president and prime minister. Ghana's parliament passed the   in February 2024, and it remains with President Nana Akufo Addo, awaiting his signature. ""Ghana's supreme court missed its opportunity to rid the country of its   of egregious colonial-era laws,"" Younes said. ""The court's failure to uphold basic rights for LGBT people only further emphasizes why the president should veto the new bill.""",https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/29/ghana-supreme-court-upholds-colonial-era-anti-lgbt-law
"Vote for Change, Mahama Urges Ghanaians As He Launches Campaign",ghana,"FLAGBEARER of the National Democratic Congress, John Dramani Mahama, has charged Ghanaians to vote to change the trajectory of the country in December because the country is headed in the wrong direction. Citing the latest Afrobarometer democracy risk report which says 87 per cent of Ghanaians thought the country was headed in the wrong direction, former President Mahama said the NPP government which has led Ghana into what he considers crisis can't be trusted to fix the problem. ""Ghana is at an important juncture in its history and the decision we make on December 7 is going to reflect on the future of this country. ""If you are going in the wrong direction, you change your course and that is why on December 7, Ghana must change course. We cannot solve the crisis in which we are with the same people who caused the crisis in the first place. The time has come for us to make a change,"" the former President said at the NDC's national campaign launch here in Tamale on Saturday. Related Articles The launch which brought thousands of NDC supporters from across the country was on the theme, 'Change to Reset Ghana.' According to the NDC leader, an experienced hand was needed to steer the country from the economic quagmire it finds itself and as a former President, he possesses that required competences to reset Ghana on the path of progress and prosperity. ""The youth of this country want an experienced safe pair of hands, a hand that they have seen do it before to come back and take this country and rescue us from the mess in which we have been dumped by the Akufo-Addo- Bawumia government,"" he said to loud cheers from the gathering. The former President said the situation appears worse than the picture being painted by the government and that it would take a lot of hard work and he alone could not do it without the support and cooperation of every citizen. Having been out of government for almost eight years, former President Mahama said he did his best though things were not perfect, the country made progress under his watch. If given the nod again, Mr Mahama promise that ""I will be truthful to you and will never tell you lies. I won't tell you things that I can't do."" Ghana's problem, he identified, has been the focus on short term policies to win elections and in the process not creating the foundation for the economy to take off. ""My pledge to you is that we will work hard, day and night to make sure that we reset the fortunes of this country.""

Dismissing the spin by his political opponents that he has only one four year term to serve as President, Mr Mahama said four years of a good leader would make more positive impact than eight years of a dishonest leader stressing that ""it is not about how long you serve but how well you serve."" Professor Naana Jane Opoku- Agyemang, the running mate for the NDC, revealed that one million women were earmarked to get credit from the yet-to-be established Women's Development Bank to make stress-free credit available to them to undertake their businesses. She said the opposition party remained committed to the establishment of the bank to advance soft loans to the women to economically empower them. The contribution of women to the socio-economic wellbeing of the country, Prof. Opoku- Agyemang said could not be overstated. ""We are the ones who take care of the children and the home. We are the ones who ensure that everybody is at peace and when there is peace at home, there is peace in the community and in the country. ""So this bank is to serve the interest of women and ensure that we can reach as many women as possible. The bank will operate by looking at the amount of money the woman needs and we have targeted one million women to benefit from the soft credit,"" she explained.",https://ghanaiantimes.com.gh/election-2024-vote-for-change-mahama-charges-ghanaians-as-he-launches-campaign/

The school which constituted the second phase of the establishment of UHAS was constructed with a $60million loan facility from the Chinese Government. It has a central administration block, lecture theatres, recovery rooms, intensive care unit, a delivery ward and a holding bay among others and has the capacity to enrol more than 5000 students. President Akufo-Addo as part of his commitment towards the development of UHAS and seeing it develop into a fully-fledged specialised institution in 2021 cut sod for the commencement of the construction of the project and took 36 months to complete. In a related development the University has conferred an honorary Doctorate degree of Science on President Akufo-Addo for his interest in the development of the University. The conferment which took place at a special congregation organised by the University Council coincided with the inauguration of the new facility. A citation in honour of the President said his special interest in the development of UHAS was noticeable and visible for the whole world to see. The Council Chair of the UHAS, Justice Jones Dotse (retired), said the honour done to the President was in appreciation of the role the president played in the China Phase II project. He said the President cut the sod for the beginning of the project and work completed even before the end of his tenure. He said the China Phase II project was the biggest in West Africa and would help increase students intake and satisfied the Universal Development Goal (UDG) four which aimed at providing access to quality education for all. Justice Dotse said UHAS was grateful to the government of Ghana and China for the successful completion of the project, adding that the University was committed to producing world class graduates who would be able to meet world standard of quality health delivery across the globe. The former Justice of the Supreme Court said through the introduction of the free SHS, students whose parents could not send them to school had been able to do so. The Vice Chancellor of UHAS, Professor Lydia Aziator, on her part said the university had since 2016 graduated 8,915 individuals in all disciplines of healthcare provision and were performing creditably in providing healthcare to the people. While expressing her profound gratitude to the President for seeing through the commencement and completion of the facility, she also appealed to him to help complete a laboratory project for the school. She noted that when completed it would become the largest institutional laboratory in West Africa. Prossesor Aziator announced that last year, the University received 13,000 applications but was able to admit only 10, 000 due to lack of infrastructure. She said the University needed financial clearance for additional 450 lecturers because of the new programmes it would be introducing and more hostels to accommodate students. The Vice Chancellor also appealed to the President to construct internal roads of the University, and provide vehicles particularly pick-up vehicles for UHAS to promote administrative work.

Some MPs had tried to justify the move, but the public fought back in opposition. Just like Ghanaians got MPs to 'Drop that Chamber' in July 2019, we must force them to 'Suspend the Siren Bill.'If you have official duties, plan your itinerary and leave home early.

Henley Passport Index - Ghana Scores 75th Globally - Disintegration On the Continent Responsible for Africa's Performance,ghana,"The Henley Passport Index, released annually, evaluates passports according to the number of visa-free travel destinations available to holders. Although the U.S. passport remains a powerful travel document, it has dropped in the rankings for the second consecutive year in 2024, marking a decade-long decline from its top spot in 2014. This means, that while the U.S. passport offers access to 186 destinations, other countries surpass it in travel freedom. Singapore comes first, granting its citizens unparalleled access to 195 visa-free destinations. A second tier is European and Asian nations France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain - closely following, with 192 visa-free destinations. In third place is a cluster of countries, including Austria, Finland, and Sweden, offering 191 visa-free destinations. At the same time, the fourth group, comprising the U.K., Belgium, and others, provides access to 190 destinations. Ghana has made notable strides in passport power, jumping from 80th to 72nd place globally. This also means passport holders can enjoy unrestricted access to 68 countries across Africa and the Caribbean, a testament to the country's growing international mobility and influence.

International relations Dr. Ismael Hlovor, suggests the current passport rankings expose the lack of cohesion among African nations. He posits that greater regional integration would significantly improve Africa's performance in such indexes. ""The strange thing about Africa is that, in as much as the whole of Africa we could actually waive visas for all of us and that would shoot up all of our scoring and everybody will have about fifty-something nations where you could go visa-free,"" He said. Dr. Hlovor debunked the assumption that a country must be a superpower to have a strong passport, instead emphasizing the importance of diplomatic negotiations, citizen cooperation, and addressing the issue of African youth exploiting visa-free travel opportunities in developed nations, which can lead to migration and potential misuse. ""It's a matter of negotiation, it's a matter of other countries reciprocating your visa waivers,"" he added. The Henley Passport Index is regarded as the definitive ranking system, categorizing global passports based on the number of visa-free destinations accessible to their holders. This esteemed index relies on data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the most comprehensive and precise travel database, and is enhanced by Henley & Partners' expert research team.",https://theaccratimes.com/henley-passport-index-ghana-scores-75th-globally-disintegration-on-the-continent-responsible-for-africas-performance/

The Prosecution said Sanogo and Falilu were cautioned, charged for the offence and put before the court, meanwhile, efforts were underway to arrest Dunga. In praying for bail, Mr Ofori said Sanogo and Falilu had fixed places of abode, not flight risk, and had people of substance to stand as sureties for them as well as assisted and still willing to assist the Police in their investigations. He said Sanogo was a middleman who bought a phone from Kwame whilst Falilu, he said was just an SHS leaver who led the Police to Sanogo, the one he got the phone from. The Prosecution opposed to the bail application and said if the accused persons were released, they would interfere with investigations, and would not appear to stand trial, being on the run since 2023 as the Police deployed intelligent officers to the Ashanti Region who arrested them only two days ago.",https://theaccratimes.com/two-persons-who-allegedly-burgled-john-kumas-widow-refused-bail/

The country is reportedly awaiting a new court ruling that might include heavier punishments under a new law.

Ms. Throssell highlighted the legal challenges posed by the recent Human Sexual Rights and Family Values Bill--a bill that would further criminalise members and allies of the LGBTIQ+ community--which was passed by Parliament in February but has not yet received presidential assent. She noted that this bill is harmful as it legitimises prejudice and exposes members of this community to violence and other forms of discrimination. ""It expands discriminatory criminal sanctions against LGBTQ+ people and it also criminalizes the work of human rights defenders, medical professionals, teachers, landlords, journalists, and media workers,"" she said.

Owned by LMI Holding Company Limited, it is the largest single roof top solar plant in Africa and constructed at the cost of $17 million. Solar power generated would be distributed to its clients within the Tema Free Zone Enclave (TFZE) industrial zone. Also known as the Mega Warehouse Rooftop Solar PV Project, it would become a beacon of sustainable renewable power progress in the country. The project spans 95.745 square metre (20 football fields) and forecasted to generate 24.7 Gwh per year in clean energy output. Financed by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the project would play a pivoted role towards renewable energy in the country's industrial landscape. Commissioning the project, Minister of State for Energy, Mr Herbert Krapah commended LMI Holding for their feat and for establishing it at the doorsteps of TFZE.

Babile D/A Primary School Cries for Support to Prevent School Collapse,ghana,"The lack of school furniture at Babile D/A Primary School in the Lawra District of the Upper West Region has forced the majority of pupils to lie on their stomachs on the bare classroom floor during school hours. This situation has caused many children to drop out of school since they could not always lie on the floor in their quest to acquire a formal education. Most parents are compelled to send their children to the farm to assist them instead of allowing them to go to school. When the   visited the school yesterday, it observed that teachers also found it difficult to move round the classrooms to teach because of the lack of space in them. While some lie down, others sit on the ground, creating a haphazard arrangement. Part of the cemented floor of the classrooms of the primary block had worn off, leaving holes in them. In an interview, one of the teachers, Mr Alhassan Jarimaya, said the dilapidated nature of the classroom blocks and the lack of furniture were affecting teaching and learning in the school. ""For a student to concentrate well in class, there should be some kind of comfort in the classroom. But because of the lack of furniture in our school, it has brought down the performance of the students. When a teacher is teaching, they do not pay attention and some even doze off,"" he said.
